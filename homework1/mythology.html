<h2 id="myt"> MYTHOLOGY </h2>
<p>In Greek mythology, Thanatos (/ˈθænətɒs/;[3] Ancient Greek: Θάνατος, pronounced in Ancient Greek: [tʰánatos] "Death",[4]
    from θνῄσκω thnēskō "(I) die, am dying"[5][6]) was the personification of death. He was a minor figure in Greek mythology,
    often referred to but rarely appearing in person.
    His name is transliterated in Latin as Thanatus, but his counterpart in Roman mythology is Mors or Letum.</p>
